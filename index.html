		<p>Hello! My name is Aspen Humphrey. I am a born and raised Nashvillian. I am currently on track to become a JR. Front End Web Developer through Nashville Software School's Cohort 20! I am highly motivated, intellegent, and looking for work with a team where my strong work ethic will be put to use! <br> I enjoy painting, reading, swimming, cooking, gardening, and making products with my harvests! I have 3 fur-babies and a loving husband who supports me in anything and everything that gives me purpose.</p>
