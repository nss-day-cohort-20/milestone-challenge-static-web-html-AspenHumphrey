		<p>Hello! My name is Aspen Humphrey. I am a born and raised Nashvillian. I am currently on track to become a JR. Front End Web Developer through Nashville Software School's Cohort 20! I am highly motivated, intellegent, and looking for work with a team where my strong work ethic will be put to use! <br> I enjoy painting, reading, swimming, cooking, gardening, and making products with my harvests! I have 3 fur-babies and a loving husband who supports me in anything and everything that gives me purpose.</p>

			<h2>Wonderland?</h2>
			<p>Chasing what seems like an incredibly quick rabbit. Diving, Jumping, and Sprinting through tunnels- Could I be in Wonderland? <br> What is this place they call "NSS"? <br> Or is the better question to ask..What in the world is JavaScript? <br> When will I stop falling through the abyss, stop talking to the caterpillar who asks "Where are you", and finally catch the rabbit? <br> As I start feeling as if I am close to "catching" the rabbit (finally grasping the concept of javascript in its entirety) Tweedle Dee and Dum throw me for a loop once more and I find my head detached by the Red Queen. <br> By now I have officially turned into the Mad Hatter. As I accept my fate of eternally attending wild tea parties I also accept the phrase "let go and let the code happen".

			<h2>Zen: State of mind. </h2>
			<p>Unity between body and mind. Or for me letting go (of control). But what does all of this mean? What does it take to really be "Zen"? <br> This has been the toughest challenge I have faced thus far. Not only here at NSS (while navigating Wonderland)- but in my daily life. I thoroughly enjoy knowing what I am doing, when, how, and why- always. I am truly searching for my center in every aspect of my life; being in Cohort 20 has escalated this idea and has been changing my core with such force I have whiplash! <br> I am becoming more and more uncomfortable with each passing day. As this level grows,  I have no choice but to let go of more and more. <br>Thus being said- I am having a difficult time “letting go” and “trusting the method”- not just in NSS but in my life. I am very thankful for this change and for this opportunity. <br>
